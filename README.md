MyMood
======

Small plugin application grabbing songs title from chrome and publish it as status messages to popular Instant Messaging software (Skype, Messages, and Adium). 
The current version is still using chrome as the main browser and only make use of specific tab number one's html document title as status messages. 
Future works will consist of adding main window as a browser view and finding the song title and artist as the status messages, instead of naively taking the document's title. 


Modification and improvisation are welcome. Please do clone it. :)
